    // Notes:
    //
    // For now we only support systems that provide the TSC frequency
    // through CPUID leaf 0x15. Please see the following:
    // - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/689875/
    //
    // We could also get the information from the Plafrom Info MSR, but from
    // testing, this value doesn't seem to be as accurate as CPUID leaf 0x15.
    //
    // One issue is that for some CPUs, the frequency is reported as 0
    // even though the numerator and denominator are provided. The manual
    // states that this means the core crystal clock is not enumerated.
    // The Linux kernel maintains a whitelist to deal with this to ensure the
    // TSC frequency is accurate. This can be seen by the following links:
    // - https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/715512/
    // - https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.19.32/source/arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c#L610
    //
    // Where the Linux Kernel got this information is still a mystery as I
    // was not able to track down where the original 24MHz and 25MHz numbers
    // came from as it appears that it originated from this patch, which was
    // written by an Intel engineer, and already contained these values:
